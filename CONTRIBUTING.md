## Contribution Guidelines

Hacktoberfest is an annual worldwide event held during the month of October. The event encourages open source developers to contribute to repositories through pull requests (PR). GitHub hosts many open source repositories that contribute to learning content. Some of the repositories actively participate in the Hacktoberfest event. In this article, youâ€™ll learn how to discover which repos are accepting PRs, and what you can expect as a contributor.

### Find a repo

To discover if a repo is participating in Hacktoberfest, you'll see the **hacktoberfest** topic on the project.

To filter all repos that have the **hacktoberfest** topic, see [GitHub Topics: Hacktoberfest](https://github.com/topics/hacktoberfest).

Alternatively, a repository may choose to use the `Hacktoberfest` label instead. This label is convenient for filtering issues. For more information, see [Filtering issues and pull requests by labels](https://docs.github.com/github/administering-a-repository/finding-information-in-a-repository/filtering-issues-and-pull-requests-by-labels).
